At first i had the following errors: 
![compileerror1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58495262/123737980-f8ae2b00-d871-11eb-87c5-6894ff65c54e.png)

But then i did use the command npm install inside assets:

after that i did enter localhost:4000 to browser and the grade class could be displayed. 

![localhost4000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58495262/123738185-55a9e100-d872-11eb-9f50-43c125aa4793.png)

After i did create mocks and stubs and added the modifications to the github repository.
